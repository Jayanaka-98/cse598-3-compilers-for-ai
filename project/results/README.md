# Experimental Results

This directory contains all experimental results and analysis for the research project.

## Results Organization

### Raw Data
- **Benchmarks**: Performance measurement data
- **Profiling**: System behavior and resource usage
- **Ablation Studies**: Component-wise analysis results
- **Comparative Studies**: Performance vs. baseline systems

### Analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Significance testing and confidence intervals
- **Visualization**: Graphs, charts, and performance plots
- **Interpretation**: Discussion of findings and implications
- **Validation**: Reproducibility and verification results

### Artifacts
- **Trained Models**: Checkpoints and model weights (if applicable)
- **Generated Code**: Compiler outputs and optimized implementations
- **Logs**: Detailed execution traces and debugging information
- **Screenshots**: Visual demonstrations of system behavior

## Experimental Standards

- Document all experimental parameters and configurations
- Include scripts for reproducing experiments
- Provide clear data provenance and version tracking
- Follow reproducibility best practices
- Include both positive and negative results

## File Naming Convention

- `YYYY-MM-DD_experiment-name_description`
- Use descriptive names for easy identification
- Include metadata files with experimental details
