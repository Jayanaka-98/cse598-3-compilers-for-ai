# Research Project

## Project Overview

This directory contains the main research project for CSE 598-3: Compilers and Runtimes for AI.

## Project Focus Areas

Based on the course curriculum, potential research directions include:

### Language-Level AI Compiler Systems
- DSPy: Declarative language model programming
- SGLang: Structured language model execution
- MTP: Meaning-typed programming
- Guidance: Controlled language model generation
- LMQL: Query language for large language models

### Traditional Compiler Optimizations
- Graph-level transformations (TVM, PyTorch 2, JAX)
- Kernel-level tuning and optimization
- Memory hierarchy optimization
- Auto-tuning and operator fusion

### Runtime and Acceleration Systems
- vLLM: Efficient LLM serving
- TensorRT: NVIDIA inference optimization
- Hardware-specific compilation (CUDA, ROCm, TPU)
- Custom accelerator integration
