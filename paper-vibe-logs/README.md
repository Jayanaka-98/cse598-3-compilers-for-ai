According to the course syllabus, vibe logs are:
- AI conversation logs where students explore and learn from course papers
- 5-10 questions asked to GPT about each paper being presented
- Due the same day as the paper presentation
- Individual submissions (not group work)

## Format Guidelines

Each vibe log should demonstrate:
- Deep engagement with the paper content
- Thoughtful questions about technical concepts
