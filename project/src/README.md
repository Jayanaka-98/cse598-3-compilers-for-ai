# Project Source Code

This directory will contain the implementation code for the research project.

## Structure

The source code organization will depend on the chosen research direction:

### For Compiler/Language Work
```
src/
├── compiler/           # Compiler implementation
├── runtime/           # Runtime system components
├── tests/             # Unit and integration tests
├── benchmarks/        # Performance evaluation code
└── examples/          # Usage examples and demos
```

### For Optimization/Auto-tuning Work
```
src/
├── optimizer/         # Optimization algorithms
├── profiler/          # Performance profiling tools
├── tuner/             # Auto-tuning infrastructure
├── kernels/           # Optimized kernel implementations
└── evaluation/        # Experimental evaluation code
```

### For Hardware Acceleration Work
```
src/
├── accelerator/       # Hardware-specific code
├── drivers/           # Hardware interface layers
├── kernels/           # Optimized compute kernels
├── memory/            # Memory management
└── benchmarks/        # Hardware performance tests
```

## Development Guidelines

- Follow Python/C++/CUDA coding standards as appropriate
- Include comprehensive tests for all components
- Document APIs and usage patterns
- Maintain clean git history with meaningful commit messages
- Include performance benchmarks and evaluation scripts
